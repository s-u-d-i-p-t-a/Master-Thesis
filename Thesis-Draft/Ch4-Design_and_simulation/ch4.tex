 can be achieved in different ways, discussed in section. In this thesis, the goal is to achieve \gls{pr} using MEMS for a broadband transmission, including the C and L bands. Moreover, the idea is to optimize the design to achieve high .  
	
	\section{Approach}
 \gls{pr} design can be approached in 2 ways. In a first approach, initially a passive \gls{pr} can be designed by introducing asymmetry and a MEMS tunable waveguide is introduced which impedes polarization rotation by reintroducing symmetry in the effective waveguide. In a second approach, the technique is reversed i.e. the MEMS tunable waveguide is used to introduce asymmetry in the waveguide structure which rotates polarization. Without the MEMS structure the polarization is not rotated. In the design principle of the \gls{pr} described here, the first approach is being followed.
